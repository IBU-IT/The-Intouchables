Aims of Project:
The main aim of this project is to develop main UWP application which will be responsive for desktop, tablets and smartphones in combination with physical. 

Introduction:
Suppose you want a new toy for your child, or you have a pet and want to play with it, bring it food or water, you can do all that over internet from your workplace or comfort of your couch. Project will be divided in three parts: hardware part, UWP for Raspberry Pi 2 running Windows IoT Core and UWP app that will control all of that over the internet.

Hardware Part
On the hardware part we’ll have vehicle with actuators controlled by Raspberry Pi 2. There will be added some sensors to have surrounding information in case that Microsoft enable receiving method in Microsoft.Azure.Devices NuGet package (that should be in next month or two). There will also be RGB lights to add more functionality.

UWP for RPi  
Raspberry Pi 2 will be running Windows 10 IoT core operative system. For controlling the hardware we’ll have UWP that will control hardware and receive/send data over Azure Cloud using IoT Hub service. 

UWP App
On client side we’ll have application that will give user control over the toy. Visual representation of app will be programmed using XAML, while back-end will be programmed in C#. App will receive/send data over IoT Hub, process that data and present that on UI.

Software / Tools needed:
•	Raspberry Pi 2
•	Visual Studio 
•	Azure Cloud
•	Hardware components 
•	Laptop, tablet, smartphone
